  My first post on the new Jekyll/Hydejack blog hosted on GitHub.io!

First post! Until recently I had not realized the importance of having an online presence as a scientist -- especially as an aspiring researcher. I was inspired to create this site by a number of people who have contributed greatly to my education through their scientific blogging: <a href="http://joshuagoings.com">Joshua Goings</a> and <a href="https://joaquinbarroso.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Joaquin Barroso</a> to name a couple. This site is designed to highlight the things I find most interesting in a wide variety of fields. As I add additional information about my various projects and musings, I will add additional categories which may be viewed from the sidebar to your left.

If you are curious to know more about my professional accomplishments and skills, please make your way over to the *About Me* page. There you can find a summary of my background, skills, and my current interests. Links to my publications are, of course, found at my *Writings* page of this site.

For summaries of my current research directions, please visit my *Research* page. To have a closer look at my coding projects to date, my *Projects* page has summaries and links to my code.

Finally, please feel free to reach out and let me know what you think of my site, my work, or my interpretations of the chemical and physical sciences. If you are interested in collaborative work or just want to discuss any errors or disagreements you might find with my writing more privately, please feel free to e-mail me! My contact information is on the &mdash; surprise! &mdash; *Contacts* page.
