  A handy list (with links!) of programs, tools, websites, and system modifications
  that have helped me as a scientific researcher. Also at the bottom is a handy
  guide to some of the "norms" in scientific writing and presentation.

A list of helpful tools, tips, modifications, and tricks for doing science in
the least-frustrating manner possible. Please keep in mind that these tools
have worked well for me anecdotally, so your style of doing research may be
*quite* different from mine and these tools might not be quite to your taste.

Having said that, these should serve as a solid starting point for finding your
style, favorite tools, and methods for streamlining your work.

Also, another disclaimer --- I am a Mac user almost exclusively at the moment,
however I have been a Windows and Linux user in the past for many, many years.
Accordingly, there may be quite a bias towards Mac-specific tools and OS
modifications.

I tend to favor Macs for my work for their (relative) stability, robust hardware
, and native command-line interface (CLI). However, I have come across a number
of really awesome open-source tools that work on Linux (and probably Windows, too
for that matter!)
