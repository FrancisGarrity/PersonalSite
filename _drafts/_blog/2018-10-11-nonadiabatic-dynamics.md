title: A Colloquial Discussion of Nonadiabatic Dynamics for The Vaguely Interested
description: >
  An overview and qualitative discussion of nonadiabatic electronic dynamics.
---

My previous research work with the [Xiaosong Li Research Group](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup/)
was primarily focused on looking at time-dependent quantum mechanical phenomena
in chemical systems. The vast majority of my work looked at the interactions
between light and molecules, exploring processes in excited state transitions and
what are commonly termed  _nonadiabatic dynamics_.

## Right... So What The Hell are Nonadiabatic Dynamics?

I'm _so glad you asked_! If you didn't, I'm glad you're here anyway, so let's
explore this a bit more. If we break down the terminology into component parts
before we get started on the heavy stuff:

### Nonadiabatic

A **non-adiabatic** process is such that some energy can be transferred between two
separated domains of a system. If you have ever studied thermochemistry or
thermodynamics, you will recognize the term **adiabatic**.

#### Classical Thermodynamics Analogy
An unfortunate aspect of quantum mechanics that makes it seem _very_ forbidding
is that it seems so damned wacky! Things that seem natural and intuitive in our
daily life suddenly break down and are no longer valid when we're talking
quantum madness. Still, I have some classical analogies that I like using
to initially visualize the problems, which we can then _pretend_ have these
weird, wacky behaviors that we know they exhibit when we fold the special sauce
of quantum mechanics into the mix.

The terms **adiabatic** and **nonadiabatic** (not to be confused with **diabatic**,
but more on that later...) in quantum mechanics and dynamics do indeed have
straighforward and rather useful analogies to classical thermodynamics.

If you have an **adiabatic** system with two parts connected by an insulating barrier, like hot coffee in a thermos that is surrounded by cold
air for example, this means no energy (*i.e.,* heat!) may escape the coffee through
the walls. The insulation of the walls prevents the transfer of energy from the
molecules of coffee to the air outside (assume it's a Perfect Thermos,
patent pending). If we consider my newly patented Perfect Thermos to have
vacuum in the walls, _of course_ the hot (fast moving) particles in the coffee
cannot transfer their _momentum_ to the air molecules outside.

Thus, our coffee stays hot, fresh, and delicious for hours and hours and hours!

If we had a **non-adiabatic** system, our thermos would instead allow the
coffee molecules to transfer their momenta to the air outside, and heat will flow
from the hot coffee to the air --- which would make for a really sucky thermos,
in point of fact. And crappy coffee.

The reason I like this analogy is that it can be directly moved into the
quantum dynamical realm.

What is this sorcery!?

Ok, so it's not sorcery, but I find the images to be very, very similar.

The transition of a single electron between [excited states](https://jjradler.github.io/blog/2018-10-09-excited-states-in-chemistry/) _is an energy-transfer process not unlike the
transfer of kinetic energy (as momentum) from molecules of my wonderful Seattle
coffee to the molecules of my chilly Seattle Autumn air_.

### Putting it Together

### Seems Complicated --- How Do You Use It?



The complexity of the dynamics comes in at this point because the excitation itself might be only one electron, but the electron can “inhabit” two excited states at once — an initially strange concept called coherence (or superposition) that I’ll discuss in a different blog post. 

Still, even if we assume the electron only inhabits one state, there are still a number of other nearby electronic states that the energy can “leak” to.  The main issue here is that — in order to reduce the complexity of our calculations of the energy of each of these states in the first place — we had to assume that they are completely uncoupled (or _insulated_) from one another by a _transition energy_ ($\Delta E$)  like the vacuum wall separating the _higher energy coffee_ from the _lower energy air_ surrounding it in my Perfect Thermos described above!
